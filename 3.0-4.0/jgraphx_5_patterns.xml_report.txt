INPUT
===================
- data sources : input/jgraphx
- input files : 400
- minSupport : 5

OUTPUT
===================
- Step 1: Mining frequent patterns with max size constraints
	 + running time = 55s
	 + root occurrences groups = 50
- Step 2: Mining maximal patterns WITHOUT max size constraint:
	 + timeout in the second step
	 + maximal patterns: 53
	 + running time: ...600s
